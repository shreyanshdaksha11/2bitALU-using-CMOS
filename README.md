# 🧮 2-bit CMOS ALU Simulation (LTspice)

This project showcases the design and simulation of a **2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **CMOS transistor-level logic** in **LTspice**. The ALU performs core operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison**, along with a custom-designed **4:1 multiplexer**.

## 🔧 Features

- ✔️ Designed completely using **CMOS logic gates** at the transistor level.
- ✔️ Implements 2-bit **adder, subtractor, multiplier**, and **comparator** circuits.
- ✔️ Includes a **custom multiplexer (MUX)** designed using pass-transistor logic.
- ✔️ Simulated and validated using **LTspice** waveform analysis.
- ✔️ Optimized for **low power** and **minimum propagation delay**.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **LTspice** – for schematic design and transient simulation.
- **Custom CMOS logic** – no standard logic libraries used.
- **Waveform analysis** – to verify correct operation and timing.
